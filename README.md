# ssh-honeypot-analysis
Hands-on SOC project with Cowrie Honeypot and Splunk. I set up a Docker-based honeypot to log SSH brute-force attacks, ingested the data into Splunk, and built dashboards to visualize attacker behavior, passwords, usernames, and GeoIP data while testing alerts for detection use cases.
